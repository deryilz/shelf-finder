                The Dublin Shelf Finder is a tool that helps students find books on the
                library shelves. To use it, navigate to the Destiny Discover page for a book
                you want to locate. Then just click the "Find book!" button for your book.
                <!--Here's a video example of the tool in action:-->
            </div>
            <!--         <video controls><source src="./demo.mp4" /></video> -->
            <div>
                The Shelf Finder was created by Derin Eryilmaz and Rudy Pandit, two 8th
                graders from Karrer Middle School who noticed the need for an easy and
                convenient way to locate books. After weeks of work, they released
                version 1.0.0 on September 17th, 2021.

            <div>
                In late 2025, the tool was rewritten to add more features:
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li>Support is no longer limited to one school.</li>
                <li>
                    Librarians can now log into an <a href="/admin">admin page</a> and
                    manage shelves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Rotated shelves are supported, as well as shelves of different sizes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The map is more interactive (supports panning and zooming).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <div>
                This project has been featured on Karrer's WKMS announcements and an
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIhfiTV7kC4">official interview</a>
                with the Dublin City Schools YouTube channel.

                Just install the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dublin-shelf-finder/lclnakicapgebmahgjdhgpgieaimnfmg">Dublin Shelf Finder extension!</a>
