first of all, structuring
we'll just store all the frontend data for the site (like index.html) in the root directory
but NOT map. map will no longer be an iframe since i think this is weak
it would be easier to understand if we just went with import() and put all code in the bookmarklet directory
which will all be js (not ts) btw

other url: https://dublin.follettdestiny.com/portal/portal?app=Destiny%20Discover&appId=destiny-JGNH-CBCP&siteGuid=8A86A3F7-0837-4032-908A-CF5371F1CB68&nav=https:%2F%2Fdublin.follettdestiny.com%2Fmetasearch%2Fui%2F41942

should work on both
let's be open to expanding to other schools if they want it
