Types of shelves:
- Fiction subtypes (some with letter ranges) (start with F or Fic)
- Other subtypes (non-fic).
- Rarely, there are shelves that will just match a list of specific call numbers ("WHO WHAT WHERE WHY" etc)
- There's a secction for everybody books. That's an example of a "prefix matcher" as it matches anything starting with E
- Same goes for biography books (B) and graphic novels (GN)
- The only other type I can see are nonfiction shelves. Just number matching on these, no alphabetical.

Some shelves have multiple parts to them. They should match multiple types of books.
So really, each shelf has multiple types.
All shelves in the library are the same width by length (2x1) but it could be helpful to add 3x1, 1x1, 2x2, etc. Not a priority rn though
Shelves can be split in half in multiple ways (aka double-sided shelves). That should probably be a splitting option. Making two shelves when it's physically a single one might be confusing...
I think it would be good to support multiple increments of angles. 15, 30, 45, etc is probably a good pick. All the way up to 360 of course.
At the same time, I think the centers of shelves should be rounded as well.
An idea: different types of shelves could have slightly different colors on the editor (not necessarily the map), so librarians can see what they're doing. Maybe it would be a good idea to have this on the map too.
Also it doesn't make sense to add bricks, only shelves.
