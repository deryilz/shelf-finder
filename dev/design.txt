no longer does each shelf have a type.
it would be easy to just say each shelf has a list of types, but that's not true either. shelves can be double-sided, and each of those sides can have a type (or multiple!). maybe i could special case this...

matches: [...]
backMatches: [...]

where backMatches might not exist.
